NOTE: Still unfinished unfortunately, I think the overall idea of developing on HW09's existing echo server was a good idea
but for my case personally I felt like I didn't understand enough to be able to fully complete this assignment. In the future,
if time allows, I will revisit and try to get more code done than just provided code or framework from Bruce's end.
